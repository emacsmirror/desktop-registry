#+TITLE: Desktop registry
#+STARTUP: showall

After reading [[https://ericjmritz.wordpress.com/2013/05/28/emacs-desktops/][this post]] I started using =desktop.el= as a simple project
file-like system. The only problem was that remembering which desktops
were where and switching between them is bothersome. This module tries
to fix that.

* Installation

  If you have [[http://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] set up you can just use:

  : M-x package-install <RET> desktop-registry

* Usage

  You can use =desktop-registry-prepend-directory= to add a new
  directory to the registry, or
  =desktop-registry-prepend-current-desktop= to add the currently loaded
  desktop to the registry. If you enable
  =desktop-registry-auto-register= it will automatically add new desktop
  files to the registry when you use =desktop-save=.

  To switch between desktops you can use
  =desktop-registry-change-desktop=, this will prompt (with completion)
  for the directory you would like to load.
