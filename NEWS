  - Add =desktop-registry-remove-desktop= command to remove desktops you
    no longer (want to) use.

  - Add =desktop-registry-current-desktop= function to get the name of
    the currently loaded desktop.

  - Add =desktop-registry-rename-desktop= command to rename a desktop.

  - Specify prompts for each action that wants a desktop selected.

  - Allow specifying of desktop name by using the universal argument.

  - Signal an error when the name for a desktop (either specified or
    generated) already exists in the registry and show a message when
    the specified directory has already been registered. Only add the
    directory if neither of these conditions occur.
